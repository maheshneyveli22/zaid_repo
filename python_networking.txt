1) find interfaces in windows using power shell; by using command - netsh interface show interface


PS C:\Users\gs1-maheswarane> netsh interface show interface

Admin State    State          Type             Interface Name
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enabled        Disconnected   Dedicated        Ethernet
Enabled        Connected      Dedicated        Ethernet 4
Enabled        Disconnected   Dedicated        Wi-Fi


2)
Berkeley packet filter

3) to enable ip forwarding in linux machine
-> use below command
->  echo 1 -> /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

.....
enable ip forwarding in kali machine by doing:
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward through the linux machine, because by default
this is set to 0 which prevents packets from flowing through kali machine
and this will disable the internet connection

5) to filter http packets in python use scapy-http

7) Intercept packets
a) First store it in queue using ip tables command
-> Thus by executing below command all requests will be trapped

-> here forward is for incoming packets
iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
-> to test in local machine, packets wont be going to FORWARD CHAIN
-> Packets go to forward chain only if they come from different computer
-> To test in local machine, we need to change this rule and mark the chain
that we want to trap packets is output chain, OUTPUT chain is the chain where the packets leaving my computer will go through

iptables -I OUTPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

-> Run the command again for ip tables , but with INPUT chain, these are the packets coming to my computer
iptables -I INPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

-> THus by using these two commands, by redirecting the output and input
chain to my Queue, all requests and responses sent to my computer will be
trapped into this queue and then i will be able to  use my python program
-> Thus only thing that is going to differ from local machine or a remote machine with ARP spoofing is the
IP tables rules  . If you are testing against remote computer or targeting local computer
-> Remote computer means : we should redirect FORWARD chain to your queue
-> If testing on local machine, then redirect output and input chains


b) Next step is to access this queue from python program
-> To do this, first we need to install netfilterqueue module

c) Write python program to access the queue and modify the packets


8)Webserver

a) Restarting webserver
service apache2 start


b) To check if a web server is listening on common ports (like 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS), you can use:
netstat -ano | findstr :80
netstat -ano | findstr :443


9) Accept-encoding
...
In the context of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), "Accept-Encoding: gzip" is a part of a request header that a client (like a web browser) sends to a server. Here's a breakdown of what it means:  

HTTP Headers:
These are lines of text included in HTTP requests and responses that provide additional information about the request or response.
Accept-Encoding:
This specific header tells the server which compression algorithms the client is capable of understanding and decompressing.
gzip:
This refers to the gzip compression algorithm, a widely used method for compressing data.
In essence, "Accept-Encoding: gzip" means: "I, the client, can accept and decompress responses that are compressed using the gzip algorithm."

Here's why this is important:

Performance Optimization:
Compressing data before sending it over the network reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred, which can significantly speed up page load times.  
Server Response:
When a server receives this header, it can choose to compress the response using gzip (if it supports it) and then send the compressed data to the client.
The server will then inform the client that the data is gzipped by sending a "Content-Encoding: gzip" header in its response.
Client Decompression:
The client, having indicated its ability to handle gzip compression, will then decompress the received data.
Therefore, "Accept-encoding: gzip" is a key part of the process that allows for more efficient transfer of data over the internet.
