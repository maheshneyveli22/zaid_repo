CLIENT SIDE ATTACKS  - BEEF FRAMEWORK

1) Beef - Browser Exploitation framework
-> BEEF allows us to launch a number of attacks on a hooked target
-> Targets are hooked once they load a hook url
        -> DNS spoof requests to a page containing the hook
        -> Inject the hook in browsed pages(need to be MITM)
        -> Use XSS exploit
        -> Social engineer the target to open a hook page

2) command to install beef in kali machine
-> first do ap-get update:
    #apt-get update
-> install beef-xss
    #aapt-get install beef-xss

-> Above command installs all libraries for BEEF and configures Beef

3) From Kali Machine we can access Beef:
start using: beef start

-> Set password for beef user

-> Then it starts beef framework and goes to the firefox to go to beef web interface to access beef
